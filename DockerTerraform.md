# How I used Docker and Terraform to provision the NGIX server in minutes.

## Check out [all the screenshot](TerraformDockerImages). 

## Steps

2. Use Terminal and bash/Linux language to open Docker
   ```
    open -a Docker
   ```
3. Created a directory and navigated to it to create a terraform file
   ```
   mkdir learn-terraform-docker-container
   cd learn-terraform-docker-container
   touch main.tf
   ```
4.
