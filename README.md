# Terraform
In this project, I familiarize myself with Terraform by provisioning an NGINX server in less than a minute using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ "Docker download"). 
[Check out](DockerTerraform.md) how I used my Terraform and Linux skills to accomplish this task. 

## What I learned from this project
1. The concept of Terraform
2. The difference between Terraform and other IaaC like [Azure ARM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview "Azure Resource Manager") and [AWS Cloud Foundation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/aws-cloudformation.html "AWS Cloud Foundation")
3. How to use Terraform
